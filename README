How to build the example programs:

  Check the settings in "Makefile" and adapt them to your system. Then
  run "make test".

  If you also want to build the "echo" program, you'll need libscheduler
  somewhere in your include path. Downloading the latest release from
  <http://cryp.to/libscheduler/> and unpacking it in the same directory
  hierarchy next to libfastcgi should do the trick: the Makefile sets
  -I../libscheduler.

  Once that's been taken care of, run "make echo".


How to run the example programs with Apache 1.3.34, mod_fastcgi 2.4.2:

  Install the "test" program to <ServerRoot>/fcgi-bin/test.fcgi (and
  echo to echo.fcgi in the same directory). Then modify httpd.conf to
  load mod_fastcgi:

  | LoadModule fastcgi_module libexec/mod_fastcgi.so
  | AddModule mod_fastcgi.c

  Enable access to FastCGI in Apache:

  | Alias /fcgi-bin/ "/usr/local/apache/fcgi-bin/"
  |
  | <Directory "/usr/local/apache/fcgi-bin/>
  |   SetHandler fastcgi-script
  | </Directory>
  |
  | FastCGIServer fcgi-bin/test.fcgi

  Go to http://localhost/fcgi-bin/test.fcgi and watch Apache's access
  log. If nothing shows up there, try the error log.


How to run the example programs with lighttpd 1.4.16:

  Install the "test" program to <ServerRoot>/fcgi-bin/test.fcgi (and
  echo to echo.fcgi in the same directory). Then modify lighttpd.conf to
  spawn the processes on demand:

  | fastcgi.server  = ( "test.fcgi" =>
  |                     ( "localhost" =>
  |                       ( "socket" => "/var/run/lighttpd-test-fastcgi.socket"
  |                       , "bin-path" => "<ServerRoot>/fcgi-bin/test.fcgi"
  |                       , "check-local" => "disable"
  |                       , "min-procs" => 1
  |                       , "max-procs" => 3
  |                       )
  |                     )
  |                   , "echo.fcgi" =>
  |                     ( "localhost" =>
  |                       ( "socket" => "/var/run/lighttpd-echo-fastcgi.socket"
  |                       , "bin-path" => "<ServerRoot>/fcgi-bin/echo.fcgi"
  |                       , "check-local" => "disable"
  |                       , "min-procs" => 1
  |                       , "max-procs" => 3
  |                       )
  |                     )
  |                   )

  Go to http://localhost/test.fcgi and watch lighttpd's access log. If
  nothing shows up there, try the error log.
