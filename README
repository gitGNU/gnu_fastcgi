C++ FastCGI Protocol Driver
===========================

:Latest Release: libfastcgi-2006-12-10.tar.gz_

Synopsis
--------

  This library implements a system-independent FastCGI protocol
  driver that can be used to handle all communication between the
  web server and the FastCGI application.

  As of now, not all the bells and whistles of the FastCGI
  protocol are implemented because the Apache web server -- which
  was used as the main test platform -- doesn't support them. The
  missing features are somewhat esotheric, though, this library
  should be quite useful as it is.

Documentation
-------------

  `FastCGI --- The Forgotten Treasure`_

      A general introduction to writing FastCGI applications in
      C++. Presented at ApacheCon 2001 and 2002.

Running ``test.fcgi``
---------------------

Apache 1.3.34, mod_fastcgi 2.4.2
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

  For this example, Apache is assumed to be installed in
  ``/usr/local/apache``. This directory is also assumed to be the
  configured ``ServerRoot``. First, create the sub-directory
  ``fcgi-bin`` in the server root. Install the ``test`` binary
  into that directory as ``test.fcgi``. Then modify httpd.conf to
  load mod_fastcgi::

    LoadModule fastcgi_module libexec/mod_fastcgi.so
    AddModule mod_fastcgi.c

  And to run the binaries found in ``ServerRoot/fcgi-bin`` as
  FastCGI applications::

    Alias /fcgi-bin/ "/usr/local/apache/fcgi-bin/"

    <Directory "/usr/local/apache/fcgi-bin/>
        SetHandler fastcgi-script
    </Directory>

    FastCGIServer fcgi-bin/test.fcgi

  Accessing the path ``fcgi-bin/test.fcgi`` will run the
  application now.

Running ``echo.fcgi``
